# TS3 Queue Bot

The TS3 **Queue Bot** was originally developed for a Teamspeak 3 server I used to manage. This bot was deployed in a production environment. As the original creator of this bot, I have decided to open source it and allow everyone the opportunity to not only use it, but tinker with it in general. Please note that as per the GNU AGPL v3 license, any modifications aside from configuration files to this bot **must** be open sourced.

## Codebase

The Queue Bot was originally developed on Javascript and then was ported over to Typescript due to modularity and code cleanliness.

If you wish to make *any* edits, you must have Typescript installed via npm. See below for more information.

## Requirements
1. node.js v18
2. A redis7 server

## Setup

1. Clone the repo to your desired system.
2. Install node.js v18 if you haven't.
3. Install the Typescript package via npm. Run: ``npm install -g typescript``.
4. Make any desired edits to the codebase or to the ``Config.ts`` file.
5. Create a .env file in the same directory that you cloned to (also the same directory as Config.ts) and do ``ENV=production`` or ``ENV=dev`` depending on the config area you want to use. (i.e. ENV=develop will pull all config values from the develop area of the config.
6. In a Linux or WSL terminal while in the directory of the repo, run ``npx tsc --build``. This will compile the code into the ``dist/`` folder.
7. Run with ``npm start`` or ``node dist/index.js``.
